        "The accuracy score above indicates that our classifer predicts on or off-task behavior accurately 67.42% of the time. This is slightly better than a 'blind guess'. In a blind guess model, the optimal strategy is to always guess that the students will pay attention, as the student pay attention on the majority of the observations. This naive strategy will result in a 66.67% accuracy rate (the ratio of observations with low attention in the validation data). Our model is slightly better than the naive strategy.  \n",
        "There are several insights we can gather from the final variables we used in the final model. To begin with, the accuracy rates were higher when the “school” variables were included. This suggests that attention rates may differ between schools; simply put, students in a certain school may be likely to pay attention compared to a student in another. This may be due to differences in the student pool or instructional quality. Secondly, the “gender” variable ended up being omitted. This suggests that the student’s gender is not a significant signal of whether the student is likely to be paying attention in class. Finally, and perhaps most interestingly, certain activities were left in the final model while others (“individual” and “wholecarpet”) were omitted. This came as somewhat of a surprise, as we initially conducted our analysis treating all activities equal. However, this result suggests that a specific subset of the activities (which remained in the model) have a relatively higher effect on whether or not the students pay attention."
